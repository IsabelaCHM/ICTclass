  <h1>Hobbies</h1>

    international flights, travelling by car or even boat. Music is another one of my favorite things to do, well, more like listening to music. I like photography quite a lot. I normally carry a digital camera around and take most of my pictures
    with it </p>

  <h1>Dreams</h1>
  <p>I hope to travel far away from Colombia. To live in a new city, see monuments and places full of ancient history. I dream of having a job that I love and am happy in. Most of all I don´t want my life to be a dull routine, I want to wake up every
    morning (or afternoon since I love sleep) and be exited for the day to come.</p>

  <h1>Pets</h1>
  <p>I have a Lulu Pomeranian called Almendra. She is around 14cm (about 5.51 in) but she believes she is a lion. Currently she is 4 years old and very noisy. She loves salmon treats, cuddles and hates thunders. Well, she also hates people but when it is convinient she will ask to be petted from anyone that is in the house. She looks a little bit like the dog on the picture since I didn´t have any pictures of her.</p>

  <h1>Funny Story</h1>
  <p> I was with my family hiking in a mountain in the middle of nowhere. My cousin and I were walking in the front until we came across a fence and had to stop. The guide came and opened the fence that was full of cows and told us to go ahead. My
    cousin and I walked in and waited for the rest of the family on one of the small hills. The cows were around and there was one on another small hill staring deeply at us and liking itself. We turned around to help my grandmother and suddenly we
    heard hooves clashing against the mud. I turned around and saw the cow hurrying towards my cousin and me. When I tell you that I jumped extremely high is basically me being scared, jumping out of the atmosphere, bouncing in Mars, turning three
    times in Saturn and flying right back onto Earth just to see the cow on the other side looking like it wanted to chase us again. My cousin and I fled the place and didn’t even wait for the fence to be opened, we jumped over it! I swear my family
    will never get over it, they will forever laugh.</p>
